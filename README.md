# NYC Citibike Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to find trends in the NYC Citibike data to help determine the feasibility of success for launching a Citibike program in Des Moines.

## Results

**Checkout Times for Users**
This graph shows us the average time that citibike users are renting bikes. Based on the data shown here, most people are renting for around 10 minutes.

**Checkout Times for Users by Gender**
Here we break down the average rental time by gender.  While significantly more men appear to rent bikes, they follow similar trends as the women.  Most people are renting for about 10 minutes, but anytime up to about 50 minutes is pretty common.

**Trips by Weekday per Hour**
The most common rental times as shown by this graph, occur during the morning and afternoon commutes.  This allows us to infer that the success of citibikes in NYC doesn't rely as heavily on tourism as some may assume.  Many locals are using these bikes for their daily communtes.

**Trips by Weekday per Hour by Gender**
Breaking down the trips by weekday per hour with the addition of by gender doesn't show us any new information - but does reiterate the fact that more men are renting bikes than women, but that trends in when bikes are rented remain consistent regardless of gender.

**Trips by Weekday by Gender and User Type**
This image shows us that the majority of male and female users do have subscriptions and are primarily renting during the week, not on the weekends.

**Top Starting Points**
The top starting points for NY Citibikes all occur in the most congested parts of downtown Manhattan. This is showing that people tend to use the bikes in areas where driving or parking aren't practical.

**Top Ending Points**
The top ending points for NY Citibikes occur in very similar areas as the starting points.  This means that people aren't necessarily riding their bikes a far distance, which would reiterate the fact that they are using them to avoid bad traffic areas.

## Summary
These results continue to point to a few key points - men are renting more bikes than women, but both men and women follow the same trends as far as day of the week and hour of the day of renting, more users have subscriptions than don't, and most users are renting during the typical workday commute hours. In addition to the following graphics, I would be interested in looking at what the most popular routes are.  This would help to find trends in how users are utilizing the bikes.  Are they driving some of their commute, parking in a garage and then finishing on a bike, or do most of our downtown users already live in the downtown area? This would help us know whether NY's downtown workforce demographic is comparable to Des Moines.  I'd also be interested in viewing a breakdown of August's peak hours by user type.  This will continue to show us how users are utilizing bikes.
